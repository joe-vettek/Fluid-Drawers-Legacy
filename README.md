# [Fluid Drawers Legacy](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fluid-drawers-legacy)



Do you miss the old Fluid Drawers? Now it's coming to 1.16.5! If you like a lot of liquids, you can ditch the complicated plumbing and just use a simple controller and slave.
This mod is licensed from phantamanta44 and has gotten support from Texelsaur and Jack McKalling.

This mod only refers to a partial implementation of the old version, so the content will not be completely consistent, and no mixins are used.
The model is original, as are some of the extra textures, which are prohibited from being used in other mods, modpacks or games without authorization.
The code part follows the ARR agreement.
