**Fluid Drawers Legacy**
========================


Do you miss the old [Fluid Drawers](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fluid-drawers)? Now it's coming to 1.16.5 and higher! If you like a lot of liquids, you can ditch the complicated plumbing and just use a simple controller and slave.  
This mod is licensed from phantamanta44 and has gotten support from Texelsaur and Jack McKalling.
